	<p style="background-color:white; color:black;"> You awaken with your entire body trapped under rubble. You are in darkness. With your hands, you can feel the rubble and dust of crumbled concrete surrounding you. Crushing each of your legs is two large blocks of concrete, not appearing to budge at all, and rendering your legs useless and immovable. You find it difficult to breathe, and when you do, you feel a sharp pain in your lungs.</p>
